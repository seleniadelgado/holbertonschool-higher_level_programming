What is OOP?
OOP is Object Oriented Programming.

“first-class everything”
The goal of Guido Van Rossum is that everything in python is a class first.
Everything is a class. 
What is a class?
A class is an object constructor of a blueprint for creating objects.

What is an object and an instance
An object is an instance of a class. Classes are used to make objects. Each time
an object is used it is as if it is using an instance of a class.

What is the difference between a class and an object or instance?
A class is an object constructor. To make an object a class is needed, an object
is a copy of a class. An instance is a variable that holds the memory address of
a variable.
An analogy is that a blueprint for the design of a house is a class. The houses
built from that blueprint are objects. One house is an instance.

What is a field?
Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields.
They can belong to the object of the class or they can belong to the class
itself. They are called instance variables and class variables respectively.

What is an attribute?
Attributes are kind of like variables, but they describe the state of an object,
or particular actions(functions) available to the object.

What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
What is self?
self is a variable that refers to the object itself. It represents the instance
of the class.

What is a method?
A method in Python is a function that tales a class instane as its first
parameter. It is a member of a class.
The difference between a function and a method is that a function can be called
just by its name, and a method does not only need the name but the class also
needs to be invoked.

What is the special __init__ method and how to use it?
__init__ function is called a constructor, or initializer, and is automatically
called when a new instance of a class is created. Inside of the function
the newly created object is assigned to the parameter self.

What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding?
Data Abstraction:
Simplified represenation of data. Reducing from something in order to have the
essentials charateristics of something.

Data Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is bundling data with the methods that operate on that data.

Information Hiding:
It is similar to encapsulating. It can be used to prevent programmers from
(un)intentionally changing parts of a code.

What is a property?
Properties are used for managing attribute access. Properties may have one of
the following methods. __get__, __set__, or __delete__

What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python?
characteristices of a variable.

What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python?
Getters are the methods for retrieving and accessing the values of attributes.
Setters are the methods for changing the values of attributes.
